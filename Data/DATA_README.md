for file names, ulness otherwise specified, the iterations are default 5000, the depth is 10. otherwise everything will be labeled. Dimensions will have a "d" after it, a solo "k" is the intercept time (when with no control effort the satellites will collide with one another). the "ki" is the number of iterations. normally k means thousand, and s means hundred. I.e 2d_5s4k.json would be a 2d system with future collisions at 500s and 4000s.
